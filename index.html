                        This tracker was developed to assist keep track of the wisps in the Spiritomb quest. All the six areas where the wisps are to be found and collected by the player is completely implemented.

                        I'm thinking of addint in the locations of all Unknown forms as well in the future. Not sure if there is something else I want to add-in, but options are still possible if I do.

                        I would like to speedrun this game in the future someday; however, this is a really long speedrun. Looking at the leaderboard
                        on <i>Speedrun.com</i>, there's no provided guides/resources. Skimming through the VODs, it seems like you just play game normally
                        and I have no clue if any qlitches even exist or used.
                    </p><p>
                        Therefore, I would at least like to make a guide to plan what and how many materials to collect, what buildings and items to make, what quests to do, and 
                        maybe provide a route for the run. This is going to take a while to make.
